# Differnet plots

# Manhattan plot
Plots that plot the p value of each variant for each chromosome to see what variant is likley to affect this disease

# Odds Ratio (OR)
Manhattan plot with Odds ratio instead of P value. 
Will display the odds for all variants with a P value under a sertain amount (to reduce noise)

# Quantile-Quantile plots (QQ)
Plot that shows how mush the P value differs from the median
If the plot plot differ far from the median line, everywhere, that means that the data is a bit... iffy
But if the last or last couple of plots spikes up, means that the data is good.
